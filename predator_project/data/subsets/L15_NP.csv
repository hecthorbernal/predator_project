(i prefer a pessimistic eta  so that there is little chance of the timetable being wrong) k updates his timetable what's your job situation these days? still doing your phd? cool re the whitelisting thing  btw  contradicting other specs has never stopped the svgwg before  so i don't know why it would start being an issue now :-) (q.v. xlink  css  etc) and re your other point  namely that html5 shouldn't set itself up to be contradicted -- i expect by the time html5 is rec  it'll be obsolete the goal isn't standards standards are just the tool the w3c rec track process has many  many issues i'm not really interested in trying to fix them at this point too many people are too invested in the process (e.g. i don't think we should have per-document maturity  i don't think it makes sense to have a spec that has no maintenance effort yet is still in use  i don't think versioning specs makes sense...) (people exit cr with test suites that are frankly laughable  e.g. svg tiny 1.2; other specs have laughably few implementation requirements  e.g. html4) anyway bbiab  gotta cycle home "
