p,4851d3bd0d66d97ddb4437f0cb527a85,When you are gone I have time to think. You are so awesome! I am confident that waiting is the best thing for you. I am sure of it. You are special and worth a lot. Dont just give yourself to anyone. Especially  from the net. Take care of your heart and mind first and always. Trust me kindness can be so much better than sex. And sex with kindness and deep care is amazing. You are making good decisions by not meeting men. I am proud of you. I hope you are so happy inside. Lots of guys are going to want to be with you. That is for sure. But I hope you are happy for your future. I think of you and I realize you can be ANYTHING you want to be. You just have to keep from making big mistakes. Sleeping with me would be one big mistake. Dont grow up to fast. Enjoy being young.<nl>You are beautiful. Trust me on this. You are the kind of girl who is going to get more and more beautiful each and every day of life. The years you are experiencing can be tough and yes boring but take this time to dream. Follow your dreams. Life is too short not too. If I slept with you I would set you back in life. I cant do that to you. You are by far the most precious person I have come in contact with in a long time. God would never forgive me if I did and I could never forgive me. I get kind of emotional and I sometimes think how nice it would be years from now to meet you and you might be a young promising doctor  or a kind teacher or just a beautiful healthy young woman. You are really precious Maddie. Pretty and funny. Hang in there with school. It will take you<nl>places. Keep yourself safe. I just realized that you are really a gift from God to me in a way. You would be an amazing daughter. I can just imagine talking to you about life. I have very little love in my life and I lose hope sometimes. You restore a lot of hope. Treat yourself like you are a rare diamond because that is what you are. Dont give yourself to just anyone. Go after your dreams. Forgive my moments of weakness but you are so lovely and when you have no love you get tempted. But when I look at your smile it is really evident you are rare  special and should be kept safe at all times. That means taking good care of your heart too. Let me take care of it a little and give you the right advice. Wait. Please wait. I see your future and it can be so amazing!<nl>Take care of the most precious thing in the world .... you!!<nl>,null,cab95a30c07dc4b6acaa5b3c63a79b33,
